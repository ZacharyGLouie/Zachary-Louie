### Who am I?
![alt_text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZacharyGLouie/Zachary-Louie/gh-pages/images/Me.png)

Hi, my name is Zachary Louie and I'm currently a 4th year college student at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  I'm currently studying Cognitive Science (with a concentration in Artifical Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction). My goal after graduation is to become a UI / UX designer where I hope to provide exceptional user experience whether it be from website designs to mobile applications designs.

I'm originally from San Francisco, California and when I'm not staying busy I like to ride bikes üö≤ , make music üé∂ , and watch basketball üèÄ
