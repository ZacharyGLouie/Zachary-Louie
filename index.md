### About Me

Hi, my name is Zachary Louie.  I'm currently a 4th year college student at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  I'm currently studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science and some of my interests include, frontend design, backend design, and user experience.  My goal after graduation is to become a UI / UX designer where I hope to provide exceptional user experience on this platform we call the Internet.  

I'm originally from San Francisco, California and when I'm not staying busy I like to ride my bike, make music, and watch basketball!
